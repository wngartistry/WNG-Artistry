	<h1>Greetings Earthlings ^_^</h1>
	<p>Meet the <b>Whimsical Nightmare Goddess (WNG)</b> herself, Raven, a self-taught artist based in North Carolina. Raven started drawing at an early age and realized how much she loved creating wacky characters! As she progressed as an artist, she was able to find a way to merge her love for horror with cartoons.

		<br>Thank you for shopping with us and hope you enjoy her whimsical nightmares.</p>
